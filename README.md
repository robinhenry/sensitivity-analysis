This repository contains most of the code I wrote during my master's thesis project:

> R. Henry. [*Data-Driven Estimation of Voltage Sensitivity Coefficients in Power Distribution Grids*](https://www.robinxhenry.com/pdf/thesis.pdf). 2021. Unpublished master's thesis. The University of Edinburgh.

It serves as an archive and is not actively maintained.
